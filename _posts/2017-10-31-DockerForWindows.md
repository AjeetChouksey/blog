## Docker for Windows


An integrated, easy-to-deploy development environment for building, debugging and testing Docker apps on a Windows PC. Docker for Windows is a native Windows app deeply integrated with Hyper-V virtualization, networking and file system, making it the fastest and most reliable Docker environment for Windows.

Base machine must have Windows 10 Anniversary Edition or Creators Update (Professional or Enterprise).
All you need to enable Hyper-V feature to provide isolation.

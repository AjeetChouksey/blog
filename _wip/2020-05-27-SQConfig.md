### Configure Tokens

> **Recommanded**

If you want to enforce security by not providing credentials of a real SonarQube user to run your code scan or to invoke web services, you can provide a User Token as a replacement of the user login. This will increase the security of your installation by not letting your analysis user's password going through your network.

These tokens are used to create Service endpoint with Azure DevOps.

Administrator - My Account - Security

You can have 1 token across the projects or you can have individual tokens.

#### Add User to project

Let's assign this user *Execute Analysis Permission* and see the difference.

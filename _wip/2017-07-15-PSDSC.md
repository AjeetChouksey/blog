*DSC*: use to deploy distributed heterogeneous configurations for software services and the environment in which these services run by giving declarative configuration. 

        -   It’s cross platform
        -   Distributed Heterogeneous Configuration Platform
        -   Declarative configurations 

New language Keywords to declaratively define Configurations that compile to Managed Object Format (MOF) DSC Providers to apply Configurations to Resources
New Cmdlets to test, apply, and restore Configurations on demand Local Configuration Manager to maintain config and Pull updates DSC Service to host Configurations and Providers centrally for Pull

*DSC Configuration Managment*

        -   Simplifies configuration
        -   Prevent configuration drifts
        -   Flexible deployment options
        -   Enable continuous deployment

### DSC Components
 ####

 #### Local Configuration Managment (LCM)

 Local Configuration Manager is the Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) engine. It runs on all target nodes, and it is responsible for calling the configuration resources that are included in a DSC configuration script.

 Configuration are declarative PowerShell scripts which define and configure instances of resources. Upon running the configuration, DSC (and the resources being called by the configuration) will simply “make it so”, ensuring that the system exists in the state laid out by the configuration. DSC configurations are also idempotent: the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) will continue to ensure that machines are configured in whatever state the configuration declares.
Resources are the imperative building blocks of DSC which are written to model the various components of a sub-system and implement the control flow of their changing states. They reside within PowerShell modules and can be written to model something as generic as a file or a Windows process or as specific as an IIS server or a VM running in Azure.
The Local Configuration Manager (LCM) is the engine by which DSC facilitates the interaction between resources and configurations. The LCM regularly polls the system using the control flow implemented by resources to ensure that the state laid out by a Configuration is maintained. If the system is out of state, the LCM uses more logic inside of the resources to “make it so” according to the Configuration declaration.

Specifies how the LCM actually applies the configuration to the target nodes. It can take the following values: "ApplyOnly": DSC applies the configuration and does nothing further unless a new configuration is pushed to the target node or when a new configuration is pulled from a server. After initial application of a new configuration, DSC does not check for drift from a previously configured state. "ApplyAndMonitor": This is the default value. The LCM applies any new configurations. After initial application of a new configuration, if the target node drifts from the desired state, DSC reports the discrepancy in logs "ApplyAndAutoCorrect": DSC applies any new configurations. After initial application of a new configuration, if the target node drifts from the desired state, DSC reports the discrepancy in logs, and then re-applies the current configuration.

        -   Responsible for validating and applying configuration
        -   Runs under the context of the SYSTEM account
        -   Only Administrators can submit configuration
        -   Defaults to running in Push mode on a clean OS / PSv4 install
        -   Supports Pull mode via file share or web service
        -   Pull mode handles custom Resource Provider deployment
        -   A single MOF file must encompass all the configuration


 #### Managed Object Format (MOF)
The Managed Object Format (MOF) was defined by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF), a vendor-neutral industry organization that Microsoft belongs to. 

        -   It acts as middle layer.
        -   Responsible for deploying configuration.
        -   One configuration (one MOF per server/ role).

 Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows-based operating systems. You can write WMI scripts or applications to automate administrative tasks on remote computers but WMI also supplies management data to other parts of the operating system and products, for example System Center Operations Manager, formerly Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM), or Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

### Push v/s Pull

*Push: This is who I am and here is my configuration*. 

*Pull:  This is who I am and give me my configuration*.

Push: In case of configuration update you need to again push the configuration.
Pull: In case of configuration update you need to update the configuration in Pull server and generate the check sum. When the target server connect with the Pull server to check the configuration, Pull server will compare the check sum and if there is difference it will send the new configuration to target node.

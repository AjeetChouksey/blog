### Traditional script v/s DSC


### DSC Components


### Push v/s Pull
    *Push*: This is who I am and here is my configuration. 
    *Pull*:  This is who I am and give me my configuration.

Push: In case of configuration update you need to again push the configuration.
Pull: In case of configuration update you need to update the configuration in Pull server and generate the check sum. When the target server connect with the Pull server to check the configuration, Pull server will compare the check sum and if there is difference it will send the new configuration to target node.

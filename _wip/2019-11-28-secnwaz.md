Security is a shared responsibility. It needs to be considered in each layer and at every component level. Even smaller negligence may cause damage to users, vendors, and clients.  In this post, I  will talk about the basic design principle around Network security.

<--more-->

While designing the Network architetcutre, you must follow '**Closed by default and open by exception**' principle. 
This will help you design the secure traffic flow between the applications, internet, and users.

Consider a requirement where your application requires to communicate with other applications/resources along with third-party APIs. To secure traffic flow between the applications and the internet your design must include configurations that control the application exposure to the external network or the internet.

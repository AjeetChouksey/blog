Security is a shared responsibility. It needs to be considered in each layer and at every component level. Even smaller negligence may cause damage to users, vendors, and clients.  In this post, I  will talk about the basic design principle and considrations around Network security.

<--more-->

While designing the Network architetcutre, you must follow '**Closed by default and open by exception**' principle. 
This will help you design the secure traffic flow between the applications, internet, and users.

Consider a requirement where your application requires to communicate with other applications/resources along with third-party APIs. To secure traffic flow between the applications and the internet your design must include configurations that control the application exposure to the external network or the internet. 

You also need to pay close attention to controlling the communication between the application resources and data. 

By limiting exposure between these resources, you reduce the effect a compromised resource can have. This can help reduce further propagation within a network.

For example your application requires following Azure resoruces:
-   Azure Web App
-   Function Apps 
-   Commos DB
-   KeyVault
-   Storage etc.

All of them are the PaaS resource, but you can still secure the traffic flow between the resoruces, internet, and users. 

Design a Virtual network, where you have NSG rules which only allow communication over port 80 and/ or 443 (prefred) along with HTTP and/ or HTTPS (prefred) over the internet. 

Apply NSG policies at Subnet level. This way you can better control the communication between your resources (e.g. Frontend subnet resoruces are not allowed to communicated to backend subnet resources directly and midtier subnets and backend subnet can not be access over internet).

Also, create a VNET endpoint for the web app. Add your web app inside the VNET endpoint. 

Similarly, you can have a VNET endpoint for Cosmos DB, KeyVault, Storage. 

If you want to add Azure Function inside your VNET, you need to opt for a premium hosting plan.

> Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints extend your virtual network private address space. The endpoints also extend the identity of your VNet to the Azure services over a direct connection. Endpoints allow you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Traffic from your VNet to the Azure service always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

VNET provides default  DDoS (distributed denial-of-service attack) for free, but if you are looking for enterprise-grade DDoS please opt for DDoS Protection standard. 

This provides enhanced DDoS mitigation capabilities for your application and resources deployed in your virtual networks.

> DDoS Protection Standard utilizes dedicated monitoring and machine learning to configure DDoS protection policies tuned to your virtual network traffic profiles. 
 
 Attack telemetry is available through Azure Monitor, enabling alerting when your application is under attack. Integrated Layer 7 application protection can be provided by Application Gateway WAF.

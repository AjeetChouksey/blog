DevOps is not meant to fail until **Process and Product backed by People with the right attitude and continuous improvement by continuous learning**.
It's not much important how you have started your journey but how consistently you improve.


## DevOps is not a role
Generally, in a project, you define the staffing requirement or onboard engineers as a 'DevSecOps Engineers' with relevant skills and experience to implement DevSecOps road map. But always remember
***
**DevSecOps is not a role... it's a philosophy... it's a culture...**
***
You can start the project by considering DevSecOps as a role during the initial phase of DevSecOps implementation in the project.  As this journey progress, you start focusing on ***Doing things right rather than only doing the right things***.

Team members need to get the transition from DevSecOps SMEs in all the areas (right from continuous planning to continuous feedback). This will not only help team members to take responsibility and perform all the required actions in their day to day work, but such practices will also improve Project DevSecOps maturity level.

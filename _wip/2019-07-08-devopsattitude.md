DevOps is not meant to fail until **Process and Product backed by People with the right attitude and continuous improvement by continuous learning**.
It's not much important how you have started your journey but how consistently you improve.


## DevOps is not a role
The project defines the staffing requirement or/ onboard engineers as a 'DevSecOps Engineer' who have skills and experience in CI-CD and other tools to support DevOps road map of their project.

**DevSecOps is not a role it's a philosophy it's a culture**.
You can define DevOps as a role when you start DevOps implementation in your project. But you need to get away from this practice as soon as you start implementing your DevOps road map. DevSecOps implementation is the responsibility of each team member. 

Team members need to get the transition from DevSecOps SMEs in all the areas (right from continuous planning to continuous feedback). This will not only help team members to take responsibility and perform all the required actions in their day to day work, but such practices will also improve Project DevSecOps maturity level.

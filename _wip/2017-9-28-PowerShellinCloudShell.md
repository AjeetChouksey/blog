PowerShell in CloudShell is now available in public preview. It's really nice and cool feature. We can run and manage the operation using PowerShell directly from the Azure Portal. 

#### Advantages:
-   Shell access from virtually anywhere: Connect to Azure using an authenticated, browser-based shell experience that is hosted in the cloud and accessible from virtually anywhere. Azure Cloud Shell is assigned per unique user account and automatically authenticated with each session. Combined with Azure portalâ€™s familiar GUI experience, Cloud Shell adds the power and flexibility of using a modern command-line experience.
-   Choose your preferred shell experience: Microsoft routinely maintains and updates Cloud Shell, which comes equipped with commonly used CLI tools including Linux shell interpreters, PowerShell modules, Azure tools, text editors, source control, build tools, container tools, database tools and more. Cloud Shell also includes language support for several popular programming languages such as Node.js, .NET and Python.
-   Common tools and programming languages included: Microsoft routinely maintains and updates Cloud Shell, which comes equipped with commonly used CLI tools including Linux shell interpreters, PowerShell modules, Azure tools, text editors, source control, build tools, container tools, database tools and more. Cloud Shell also includes language support for several popular programming languages such as Node.js, .NET and Python.
-   Persist your files in attached cloud storage: Cloud Shell attaches an Azure File share to persist your data. On first use, Cloud Shell will prompt to create a file share in Azure File storage (or attach an existing one) to persist your data across sessions and Cloud Shell will automatically re-attach it for subsequent sessions.

#### Windows and Linux together.
in the back their are bunch of container with PowerShell (Windows) and Bash (Linux). As you connect, Azure go and figure out the respective VM and figure out the container. Please make a note that thier is not cost for these container. Cloud Shell billing is based only on the Azure File storage used to persist your data. Your total cost depends on how much you store, the volume and type of storage transactions and outbound data transfers, and which data redundancy option you choose.

-   Cloud Shell runs on a temporary machine provided on a per-session, per-user basis
-   Cloud Shell times out after 20 minutes without interactive activity
-   Cloud Shell can only be accessed with a file share attached
-   Cloud Shell uses a the same file share for both Bash and PowerShell
-   Cloud Shell is assigned one machine per user account
-   Permissions are set as a regular Linux user (Bash)

Here we have option to increase the font size as well as resize the Window.

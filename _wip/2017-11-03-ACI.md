>## Azure Container Instance (ACI)

Azure Container Instances (ACI), Azure became the first cloud provider to offer containers as a core part of its infrastructure, enabling the use of containers without the overhead of deploying and managing virtual machines. In this session, learn how ACI compares to virtual machines and how you can use it to quickly and easily deploy Linux and Windows containers in Azure. We also explain how ACI compares to other container management options in Microsoft Azure, including Azure Container Service, and introduce the ACI connector for Kubernetes.

**DevOps... DevOps... DevOps..**. Everyone is talking about DevOps. There is significantly increased demand of resources who have knowledge and expertise in this area. IT companies and client are struggling to get DevOps expert due to lack of skilled resources in this area. 

In many of my DevOps ignite sessions, people ask do they need to change their current or primary skill and build skills in this area. 

Answer is very simple '**NO**'. You don't need to change your skills, but you need to adopt DevOps philosophy in your day to day activities.

The very first thing I tell them DevOps is philosophy about ***People, Process and Product***.

DevOps series is all about some of the tools which I learned and used to implement various phases of DevOps philosophy.
